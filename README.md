#Cylindrical Wave Field Experimental Data
The experiments were conducted to measure the linear cylindrical coefficients of bodies in water waves. The experiments employed two body geometries, an attenuator consisting of a horizontal pitching cylinder, and a terminator made up of a bottom-hinged flap. An array of 59 wave gauges was arranged in a circle-spoke pattern, where the circle of wave gauges was necessary for deriving the cylindrical coefficients, and the spokes, which extended radially further afield, were used for validation. Both the scattered and the radiated waves of the bodies were examined at three frequencies.

This repository contains the MATLAB scripts used for processing the data.
